# Pull Request Review
Now that you submitted your pull request it needs to get reviewed and approved. Team members will have the ability to review your code and make comments, request changes, or approve. Each pull request must have one review before it gets approved and merged. Merging will **ONLY** be done by the Team Leader. Please do not merge any changes.  

Ask another team member to review your pull request. If you have reviewed a pull request already, please make sure to give someone else a chance to conduct a review.


### What to Review? 
When asked to review a pull request, navigate to Git Hub and click on Pull Requests. Find the pull request you were asked to review and click on the pull request title.
