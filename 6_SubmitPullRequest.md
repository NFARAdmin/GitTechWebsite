# Submit a Pull Request

You pushed your branch changes and you are now ready to have your changes merged into the main branch.  A project will have certain rules around pull requests. In most cases you will not be able to merge your changes directly without a review and approval from another member of the project. This is to protect the main branch from any code that could break it. Remember that social contract?
