# Team Website Contribution
Now you get to make some changes. The website has "cards" to display some information for each cohort. Each persone will be assigned a cohort number and will only make changes to that "card". 

### 1. Navigate to your folder:
Open Terminal and navigate to your project folder. Make sure to checkout the branch you created earlier and check status - this is important. 

### 2. Open VSCode

### 3. Make the assigned changes to the website
Each person will be assigned a cohort card number. You can find in in the the HTML under "title" ```<p class="title">COHORT 1</p>```. 
```
 <div class="column">
          <div class="card">
            <img src="images/SamplePic.jpg" alt="Cohort1">
            <div class="container">
              <h2>Your Name</h2>
              <p class="title">COHORT 1</p>
              <p>Some text that describes me lorem ipsum ipsum lorem.</p>
              <p>example@example.com</p>
              <p><button class="button">Contact</button></p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
 ```
